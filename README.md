# Awesome Egypt Open Source Contribution Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to the **Awesome Egypt Open Source Contribution Analysis** project! This initiative is part of the **Awesome-egypt-opensource** program, which aims to promote and support open source projects developed by Egyptian engineers. Our goal is to encourage collaboration, mentorship, and accessibility to open source contributions in Egypt.

## Project Objectives

This project aims to gather and analyze statistics related to open source contributions by Egyptian developers. The analysis includes various aspects, such as:

- **Geographic Distribution**: Identifying which cities or areas in Egypt have the most open source contributors.
- **Programming Languages**: Analyzing the top programming languages used in Egyptian open source projects.
- **Popular Projects**: Highlighting the most active and popular open source projects from Egypt based on contributors, commits, stars, and forks.
- **International Contributions**: Exploring which non-Egyptian projects have the highest number of Egyptian contributors.
- **Industry Trends**: Categorizing the top industries or topics for which Egyptians are building open source projects.
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: Identifying the most commonly used frameworks and libraries in Egyptian open source.
- **Database Usage**: Analyzing the top database engines utilized in these projects.
- **Documentation Quality**: Assessing the documentation quality of the projects.
- **Pull Requests and Issues**: Evaluating the status of pull requests and issues across the projects.
- **Licenses**: Identifying the most common licenses used in the projects.
- **CI/CD Practices**: Examining the integration of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) in these projects.

## Deliverables

This project consists of:

- Comprehensive Python notebooks for each category of statistics.
- Visual representations (graphs) for all collected statistics, including tables, pie charts, and bar charts.
